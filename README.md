Have the Number of Extreme Weather Events Increased Over the Past Decade? (2010-2020)
================
by Team Weather - Colin, Kailer, Jennifer


## Summary

As climate change becomes an increasingly urgent global concern, understanding its influence on extreme weather patterns is essential. This study investigates how the frequency of extreme weather events has shifted over time and identifies which specific types of events have become more or less common. To further evaluate the severity of these events, we also analyze associated economic impacts by examining recorded damage costs. We used data from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association) for the years 2010–2020.

## Methods

We used the NOAA StormEvents dataset (2010–2020), which records all reported extreme weather events in the United States. Our approach included:
Cleaning and organizing event data by year, event type, and county.
Creating visualizations to explore patterns in:
overall event frequency,
severity indicators (damage costs, injuries, fatalities),
the frequency of specific event categories, and
geographic distribution of tornado incidents.
Comparing trends across time to evaluate whether increases in event frequency align with changes in severity.

No statistical models were used instead we relied on descriptive graphs to reveal large scale patterns.

## Analysis

Our findings indicate that while extreme weather events became more frequent over the decade, their severity did not increase at the same rate. From 2010–2014, frequency trends closely aligned with injuries and fatalities, but after 2016 the number of events continued to rise even though total damages and casualties did not. This suggests that later events may have been less intense or occurred in areas with improved preparedness. Event specific trends reveal that floods and flash floods consistently account for a large portion of total events, with spikes around 2011 and 2018, while blizzards and wildfires remain comparatively low but steady. A geographic analysis of tornadoes further shows that the central United States, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and northern Texas—experiences significantly higher tornado activity than coastal or northeastern regions.
Overall, the results highlight that increases in event frequency do not necessarily imply increases in severity, raising important considerations for disaster planning. 

## Conclusions

Across 2010–2020, extreme weather events became more frequent, but severity did not rise at the same pace. This mismatch highlights that frequency alone cannot fully describe climate risk. Preparedness, geography, and event type all play important roles in determining impact. The study is limited by its reliance on a single decade of data and by potential inconsistencies in reporting across states. Future research could expand the time window, incorporate additional climate variables, or examine how community resources influence vulnerability and recovery.
