================
by Team Weather - Colin, Kailer, Jennifer


## Summary

As climate change becomes an increasingly urgent global concern, understanding its influence on extreme weather patterns is essential. This study investigates how the frequency of extreme weather events has shifted over time and identifies which specific types of events have become more or less common. To further evaluate the severity of these events, we also analyze associated economic impacts by examining recorded damage costs. We used data from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association) for the years 2010–2020.
