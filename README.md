Continuation of DCS117 Final Project
================
by Colin Lansky

This is a continuation of my group final project from my fall 2025 DCS117 course with Professor Baker. Currently a work in progress, writing this mainly to remind myself of what everything means.

## Memo

Currently the final result from the project, minus last minute revisions.

## Data (folder)

The all-years file is where I am reading all the different csvs and binding them. I also have some info at the bottom about when different events start beign recorded.

I made the all-years folder, I should probably rename this and move it there.

in that all-years folder is the python file of how I actually made the all-years read csv file. 

## Data (data)

Our data is from the NOAA Storm Events Database, v3.1.
